# Inter-Process-Communication-System
This project demonstrates IPC methods—message passing, shared memory, semaphores, and pipes—for process communication and synchronization. It highlights race condition prevention and provides visual feedback on communication flows, illustrating each IPC method’s strengths in loosely coupled systems.
